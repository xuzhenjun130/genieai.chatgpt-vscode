  <summary><strong> 💬 Save your conversations and continue at any time</strong></summary>

1. Conversation history

- The goal: Collect feedback and measure the compatibility across different machine, OS setups.
- We are experimenting a new feature to help you store your conversations in your disk using VS Code global storage API.
- You need to opt-in to use this feature as this is experimental to collect feedback from the users. Setting name: `genieai.enableConversationHistory`
- With this experimental feature, keep in mind this feature has limitations at the moment and may have bugs, use it at your own risk.
- You may want to remove the stored files manually for privacy from time to time, extension doesn't have any way to modify the files other than writing new threads to files.
- All conversations start with name 'New chat' and you can change it in `genie.json` file.
- The conversations are stored only on your machine, using VS Code's provided global storage API for extensions.

2. Misc. bug fixes and improvements

# Features

The extension comes with context menu commands, copy/move suggested code into editor with one-click, conversation window and customization options for OpenAI's ChatGPT prompts.

We recently introduced Genie to `Problems` window. You can investigate your compile-time errors asking Genie. Simply click on Lightbulb/suggestion icon to ask Genie to help you. The credits for this idea goes to @cahaseler; if you are interested in seeing his Genie-companion extension visit [this issue](https://github.com/ai-genie/chatgpt-vscode/issues/31)

# Troubleshooting

## FAQ

- **For general FAQ please visit OpenAI's own page**: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7039783-chatgpt-api-faq
- **How can I clear or re-enter API key**: use `Genie: Clear API Key` command. Click `Commands` on the home page to see all commands available. You can also click on `Change API Key` on the home page.
- **Editor view uses text-davinci-003**: It's by design at the moment since it's the only model that can guarantee a code response and the view doesn't need a conversational context. Please follow this issue for details [#24](https://github.com/ai-genie/chatgpt-vscode/issues/24)
- **Is the ChatGPT API included in the ChatGPT Plus subscription?**: No, the ChatGPT API and ChatGPT Plus subscription are billed separately.
- **Can I view the API Key after storing it?**: VS Code secrets storage won't allow you to read the API Key after storing it. You may clear or reenter another key if you are facing issues.
- **Does Genie support proxies**: See this issue to enable local proxy: https://github.com/ai-genie/chatgpt-vscode/issues/7
- **Usage in Remote environments**: See this issue about remote/SSH: https://github.com/ai-genie/chatgpt-vscode/issues/3
- **Unable To Use GPT-4 Models**: You need GPT-4 API Access (Different than GPT-4 on ChatGPT Plus subscription) https://github.com/ai-genie/chatgpt-vscode/issues/6
- **Azure OpenAI Service: Unsupported data type Error**: This means you didn't select the right base model for your Azure OpenAI service. Make sure to select the base GPT model you used to create your Azure OpenAI Service deployment

## Common Issues

- It's possible that OpenAI systems may experience issues responding to your queries due to high-traffic from time to time.
- If you get `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`, it means that you are either making too many requests OR your account doesn't have enough credit. Your account may also have expired.

  - If you see `insufficient_quota` in the error, you could run the following cURL command to check if your account has enough quota. (Make sure to replace `$OPENAI_API_KEY` with your key that you use in this extension)

  ```bash
    curl https://api.openai.com/v1/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
      -d '{
      "model": "text-davinci-003",
      "prompt": "Can I make a request?\n\n",
      "temperature": 0.7,
      "max_tokens": 256,
      "top_p": 1,
      "frequency_penalty": 0,
      "presence_penalty": 0
    }'
  ```

- If you get `HTTP 404 Not Found` error, it means one of the parameters you provided is unknown (i.e. `genieai.openai.model`). Most likely switching to default `model` in your settings would fix this issue.
- If you get `HTTP 400 Bad Request` error, it means that your conversation's length is more than GPT/Codex models can handle. Or you supplied an invalid argument via customized settings.
- If you encounter persistent issues with your queries
  - Try `Genie: Reset session` to clear your session/conversation or `Genie: Clear API Key` to clear your API Key and re-enter
  - As a last resort try restarting your VS-Code and retry logging in.
- If you are using Remote Development and cannot use ChatGPT
  - In `settings.json` add `"remote.extensionKind": {"genieai.chatgpt-vscode": ["ui"]}`
