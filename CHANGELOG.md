### 1. Conversation history

#### Save your conversations and continue at any time

- The goal: Collect feedback and measure the compatibility across different machine, OS setups.
- We are experimenting a new feature to help you store your conversations in your disk using VS Code global storage API.
- You need to opt-in to use this feature as this is experimental to collect feedback from the users. Setting name: `genieai.enableConversationHistory`
- With this experimental feature, keep in mind this feature has limitations at the moment and may have bugs, use it at your own risk.
- You may want to remove the stored files manually for privacy from time to time, extension doesn't have any way to modify the files other than writing new threads to files.
- All conversations start with name 'New chat' and you can change it in `genie.json` file.
- The conversations are stored only on your machine, using VS Code's provided global storage API for extensions.
